# 2024_maps_supplement
Supplementing Datameet maps with some newer, updated ones for the 2024 elections

The maps in the [Datameet repo](https://github.com/datameet/maps) meet most of my needs, but some areas like Assam and J&K still have pre-delimitation parliamentary seat borders.

This is an attempt to provide maps that can substitute some of the outdated ones in the Datameet repo.

These geojsons aren't research quality, but I think they're good enough for the purpose of visualising on websites.

### Done
* [Sikkim assembly seat map](sikkim_assembly_updated.geojson)
* [Assam Lok Sabha seat map](assam_ls_new_borders.geojson)
* [J&K Lok Sabha seat map](j_and_k_ls_new_borders.geojson)
* [Ladakh Lok Sabha seat map](ladakh_ls_new_borders.geojson)
* [India Lok Sabha seat map](india_ls_seats_545.geojson) (incorporating the newer borders of all the states above)
* [India Lok Sabha seat map](india_ls_seats_543.geojson) (same as above, but with 543 features, one for every Lok Sabha seat)

### Pending
* J&K assembly seat map (will do this in July)

### Notes
* source maps used for sikkim, assam, ladakh, j and k are in the [source maps](source maps) folder
