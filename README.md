# 2024_maps_supplement
Supplementing Datameet maps with some newer, updated ones for the 2024 elections

The maps in the [Datameet repo](https://github.com/datameet/maps) meet most of my needs, but some areas like Assam and J&K still have pre-delimitation parliamentary seat borders.

This is an attempt to provide maps that can substitute some of the outdated ones in the Datameet repo.

These aren't research quality, but I think they're good enough for the purpose of visualising on websites.

### Done
* Sikkim assembly seat map
* Assam Lok Sabha seat map
* J&K Lok Sabha seat map
* Ladakh Lok Sabha seat map
* India Lok Sabha seat map (incorporating the newer borders of all the states above)
* India Lok Sabha seat map (same as above, but with exactly 543 features)

### Pending
* J&K assembly seat map (will do this in July)
